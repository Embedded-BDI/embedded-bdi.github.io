Because this project is based on [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/wp/), it is important to list some of features available on Jason that have not yet been implemented in Embedded-BDI.

Some of the unsupported features are:

* Statements are limited to 256 distinct values due to variables used internally (`uint8_t`);
* Predicates;
* Annotations;
* Unification algorithm for plans' contexts;
* Internal actions;
* Advanced _troubleshooting_ tools: Mind inspector, Console, Sniffer Agent.
* Dynamic belief base;
* Multi-agent support;
* Support for/integration with Artifacts and Organizations.
