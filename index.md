Embedded-BDI allows programming deliberative [BDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief%E2%80%93desire%E2%80%93intention_software_model) agents for embedded systems using [AgentSpeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgentSpeak)-like syntax.

This project is based on the [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/wp/) interpreter and has been developed by the multi-agent research team at the [Federal University of Santa Catarina](https://en.ufsc.br/).
